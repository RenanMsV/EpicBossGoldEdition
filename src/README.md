#### == EpicBoss | EpicBossRecoded | EpicBoss Gold Edition ==

Is a series of a plugins that have been developed from EpicBoss to EpicBossRecoded and ended with EpicBoss Gold Edition.
Today all of these plugins are dead. The development ended couse I haden't time or money to continue. I hade to get a
jobb and hade to study more. So I came to a decision to leave this plugin behind me. This is the projekt that made
the programer that I'm today, thanks to the community.
